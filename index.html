    <title>Journal of Konfidentiality Evasion (JOKE)</title>
  <body>
    <h1>Journal of Konfidentiality Evasion (JOKE)</h1>
    JOKE is a new style of journal designed to reduce bureaucracy via
    direct action.

    <h2>Purpose</h2>

    JOKE publishes results in all fields of art and science which are
    hindered by internal data security rules.  Primarily, submissions
    are of data which organizational rules require to be classified
    "confidential" (limiting the use of common scientific tools), but
    there is no reason for it to be confidential.  Publication in JOKE
    will allow the data to be classified "public", so that it can be
    used in online services such as ChatGPT or Github, and sharing
    with collaborators.

    <h2>Publication conditions</h2>

    Don't publish anything that is can not be made public.  Data is
    not transferred out of your web browser anyway.

    <h2>Submission</h2>

    <input type="file" id="upload" multiple /><br>
    Or enter free-from text:<br>
    <textarea id="data" name="data" rows="10" cols="120"></textarea>
    <br>
    <input type="submit" onclick="publish()" value="Submit">
  </body>


  <h2>How it works / to do</h2>

  JOKE uses Javascript to compute a sha256 hash of the uploaded
  text/data.  There is no transfer out of the web browser, and no
  outside resources loaded.  Future plans:

  <ul>
    <li>Preparation of security evaluation, target submission data 1
    April 2024.</li>
  </ul>
