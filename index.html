    <h1>Journal of Konfidentiality Exceptions (JOKE)</h1>

    JOKE is a radically creative journal designed to solve research
    sustainability problems.


    <h2>Purpose</h2>

    JOKE publishes results where science and art meet technology and
    business, but is hindered by internal data security rules.
    Primarily, submissions are of information which organizational
    rules require to be classified "confidential" (limiting the use of
    common tools), but there is no reason for it to be confidential.
    Publication in JOKE is a game changer, since it allows the
    information to be classified "public", so that it can be used in
    online services such as ChatGPT or Github, and sharing with
    collaborators.


    <h2>Publication conditions</h2>

    Don't publish anything without the legal, ethical, and practical
    ability to be made public.  However, our innovative design does
    not transfer any data out of your web browser anyway.


    <h2>Submission</h2>

    <input type="file" id="upload" multiple /><br>
    Or enter free-from text:<br>
    <textarea id="data" name="data" rows="10" cols="120"></textarea>
    <br>
    <input type="submit" onclick="publish()" value="Submit">
  </body>


  <h2>Background</h2>

  Some universities have rules which state that all research data is
  "confidential", which basically means that standard open science
  practices can't be followed, nor can the latest and best tools be
  used.  Published information can be "public" (but note that journals
  aren't evaluated for IT security, so how are we supposed to send
  them the unpublished information for peer review?, since it's still
  confidential until publication is done).  JOKE provides a way to
  publish any data, without actually sharing it, so that researchers
  may apply a more appropriate security classification, do their
  research, and share the data appropriately to its own circumstances.

  If you don't understand JOKE, that just shows how disconnected IT
  security rules can be from the community it's supposed to serve.


  <h2>How it works / to do</h2>

  JOKE uses Javascript to compute a sha256 hash of the uploaded
  text/data, and returns that as the publication identifier.  It
  doesn't share data, instead authors can share data as they see fit.
  There is no transfer out of the web browser, and no outside
  resources loaded.  Future plans:

  <ul>
    <li>Preparation of security evaluation, target submission data 1
    April 2024.</li>
  </ul>
